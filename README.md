## About

The three input fields are wrapped inside an ```<div>``` Element.
and each input field is also wrapped inside ```<div>```. So that a user can style it according to the need in the project.

Whenever the wrong Pincode is entered red border appears on the pin code input field and on entering a right pin code, city and state input fields get automatically filled with correct data

### Development and Testing

1. Set-up the React-Pincode module by dowloading its dependencies, using `npm install` command.	
2. Build the module using `npm run build`	
3. Link the module for testing using `npm link` command.	
4. Change your directory to `test-server` directory, using `cd test-server`	
5. Install the dependecies using `npm install`	
6. Now run `npm link react-pincode`	
7. Congratulations! You have set-up the test server for react-pincode.	
Now just run `npm start` from `test-server` directory to launch the test-server.	
8. You don't need to stop this server, the changes made in the module will be reflected automatically each time you build them using `npm run build`
